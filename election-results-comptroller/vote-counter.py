# TO-DO: WRITE A FUNCTION THAT TAKES TWO INPUTS--THE LIST OF VOTES, AND THE LIST OF CANDIDATES--
# AND PRODUCES AS OUTPUT A LIST OF INTS THAT CONTAINS THE NUMBER OF VOTES RECEIVED BY EACH CANDIDATE


# IMPORTANT: THE OUTPUT LISTS FROM THE ABOVE TWO FUNCTIONS SHOULD HAVE INDICES THAT CORRESPOND WITH EACH OTHER
# E.G., IF THERE ARE THREE CANDIDATES--JOHN, JACOB, & SCHMITT--THAT RECEIVED 3, 5, & 7 VOTES RESPECTIVELY,
# THEN THE FIRST OUTPUT LIST OUGHT TO BE ["JOHN", "JACOB", "SCHMITT"]
# AND THE SECOND OUTPUT LIST OUGHT TO BE [3, 5, 7]
