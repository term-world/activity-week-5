# CITY HALL RANSACKED, NO PERPETRATOR IDENTIFIED

That was the leading headline in the `term-world-tribune` today.
As the mayor has already indicated, he needs *your* assistance
in cleaning up the mess left behind by the mysterious vandal.

There's two big asks for the work ahead of you:
1. Restore order to the `term-world` demographic data stored in the city hall archives.
2. Assist with closing out an important `term-world` election.

## DEMOGRAPHIC DUE DILIGENCE

A bunch of data stored in the city hall archives was compromised during the break-in at city hall.
Everything from data on the registered elected officials of `term-world` to poll response data has been tampered with.
Or in same cases, outright destroyed.

Your assistance is required in order to restore and rebuild the impacted data.

The data that needs your attention has already been partitioned into **three** separate packets.
Each packet will have its own `instructions.md` document that will further direct you
on what specifically needs to be done within the contents of that particular packet.

Our city is counting on you.

## THE RACE FOR `term-world` COMPTROLLER

Our fearless mayor has recently learned that any city worth it's salt has a comptroller,
and we've been ashamed to discover that that our own fair `term-world` is without one!

While our analysts work tirelessly to figure out *what* a comptroller actually does,
our brave mayor has already taken steps to bridge this glaring gap: 
namely, he's recently called for a special election, which just concluded right before the attack on city hall.
We've received all the votes and have them safely stored here in the building. But we have no way to count them!
You see, the supercomputer that handles all of our polling needs--sending out polls, tallying results, etc.--
seems to have been one of the mysterious vandal's targets in their mystifying attack on the building.

We have a technician looking into fixing it, but he tells us the machine must've been built
by a complete amateur--saying something about spaghetti stuck in its code or something?
We're not sure. We stopped listening when they started talking about HTTP requests.
In any case, the technician assures us that it'll take *at least a week* before he can
restore order to the supercomputer, but the mayor says we need those poll results *NOW*.

We need your help in building a `vote-counter` machine that can, if nothing else,
at least go through our collection of votes and determine a winner.

Again, our city is counting on you. We need that comptroller position filled. *Obviously.*
