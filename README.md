# CITY HALL RANSACKED, NO PERPETRATOR IDENTIFIED

That was the leading headline in the `term-world-tribune` today.
As the mayor has already indicated, he needs *your* assistance
in cleaning up the mess left behind by the mysterious vandal.

There's two big asks for the work ahead of you:
1. Restore order to the `term-world` demographic data stored in the city hall archives.
2. Assist with closing out an important `term-world` election.

## DEMOGRAPHIC DUE DILIGENCE

A bunch of data stored in the city hall archives was compromised during the break-in at city hall.
Everything from data on the registered elected officials of `term-world` to poll response data has been tampered with.
Or in same cases, outright destroyed.

Your assistance is required in order to restore and rebuild the impacted data.

The data that needs your attention has already been partitioned into three separate packets.
Each packet will have its own `instructions.md` document that will further direct you
on what specifically needs to be done within the contents of that particular packet.

Our city is counting on you.
