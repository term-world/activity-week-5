## INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREFERRED FOOD DATA ANALYSIS

Our compassionate and most entrepreneurial mayor has been tirelessly collecting data
on the preferred food of `term-world` citizens,
all with the goal of eventually opening a massive parking lot for food trucks
in place of the current `term-world` wildlife reservation, which nobody even visits.

Of course, his plans are for naught if he cannot provide the people of `term-world` the food they most desire!

Our previous analysis on the preferred foods of `term-world` citizens
was lost in the attack on city hall
(leading us to believe that the attacker *may* be an extremist eco-terrorist,
or worse--someone that just doesn't like good food).
It's your job to review the data and put together a program that can
*count the number of votes each food choice received*.

The program is already outfitted with the capability to read in data from the `preferred-food-poll-results.txt` file.
It's set up so that the series of votes is stored in a list called `preferred_foods`,
but you'll need to figure out how to actually *count* the votes.
